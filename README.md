# 🧾 Multi-Step Registration Form (React)

This is a responsive **multi-step registration form** built with **React**. It guides users through a three-step registration process — collecting personal details, account credentials, and finally providing a preview before submission. Form data is validated and persisted in `localStorage` to prevent accidental loss of progress.
